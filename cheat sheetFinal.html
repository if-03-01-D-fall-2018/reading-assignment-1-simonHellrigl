    <h2>URL -> Uniform Resource Locator<br>
    HTTP -> Hypertext Transfer Protokoll <br>
	HTML -> HyperTextMarkupLanguage<br>
    A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html <br>
    colloquially termed a web address <br>

    Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI. The URI generic syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of five components: <br>
    Examples of popular schemes include http, https, ftp, mailto, file, data<br>

    A web browser will usually dereference a URL by performing an HTTP request to the specified host, by default on port number 80. URLs using<br>
    the https scheme require that requests and responses will be made over a secure connection to the website.<br>

    The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.<br>

    web Server: primary function is to serve content; <br>

    While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files. <br>

    Web servers are not only used for serving the World Wide Web. They can also be found embedded in devices such as printers, routers, webcams and serving only a local network. <br>

    Web client: is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. <br>

    !!!A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine!!! <br>

    n order to connect to and display websites on their device, a user needs to have a web browser installed.[2]<br>

    function of Web browser: fetch information resources and display them on a user's device

    Sample Questions<br>
    </p>
    <br><h3>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?</h3>
        <p>To locate or address specific pages, images or videos in a website, you have to use something what's called an URL.<br>
        <em>URL's (Uniform Resource Locators) were defined in RFC 1738 in 1994 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.<br>
        Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.<br>

        General components of an URL<br>
        A typical URL could have the form <em>http://www.example.com/index.html</em>, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname  and a file name (index.html).</p>

        <br><h2>Web Sever</h2>
        What is a web server?<br>
        <p>Web server refers to server software, or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can serve contents to the World Wide Web.<br>
        A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.<br>

        What does a web server?<br>
        The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.<br>
        The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>
        Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.</p>

        How can content be stored on a web server?<br>
        Web servers are able to map the path component of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into:<br>
         - A local file system resource (for static requests)<br>
         - An internal or external program name (for dynamic requests)<br>

        For a static request the URL path specified by the client is relative to the web server's root directory!<br>

        <br>Today websites are also able to support serverside scripts or applications such as php, ruby or node.js.<br></p>

        <br><h2>Web Client</h2>
        What is a web client?<br>
        <p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.<br>
        Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct URL, enabling browsers to retrieve and display them on the user's device.</p>

        <br><h2>Hello World</h2>
         HTML-Head Element<br>
        <p>The head tag is used as a container for meta data, and is set between the html and body tag</p>

        !DOCTYPE Element<br>
        <p>The !DOCTYPE tag is used to signalize the browser, that he has to interpret this file as HyperTextMarkupLanguage.</p>

        The Head- and Body-Elements<br>
        <p>The Head and Body Elements are the topmost elements in a html page.<br>
        The Body element contains all the website's content.</p>

        HTML-Head Element<br>
        <p>The head tag is used as a container for meta data, and is set between the html and body tag</p>

        The EM Element<br>
        <p>The em-Element is used to emphasize text in your website. You have to mark the emphasized text using the &lt;em&gt; tag.</p>

        The STRONG> Element<br>
        <p>The strong-Element is used to mark text in your website as important or bold. To use it, simply mark your text with the &lt;strong&gt; tag.</p>
