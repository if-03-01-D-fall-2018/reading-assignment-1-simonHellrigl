    <h2>URL -> Uniform Resource Locator<br>
    HTTP -> Hypertext Transfer Protokoll <br>
    A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html <br>
    colloquially termed a web address <br>

    Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI. The URI generic syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of five components: <br>
    Examples of popular schemes include http, https, ftp, mailto, file, data<br>

    A web browser will usually dereference a URL by performing an HTTP request to the specified host, by default on port number 80. URLs using<br>
    the https scheme require that requests and responses will be made over a secure connection to the website.<br>

    The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.<br>

    web Server: primary function is to serve content; <br>

    While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting web forms, including uploading of files. <br>

    Web servers are not only used for serving the World Wide Web. They can also be found embedded in devices such as printers, routers, webcams and serving only a local network. <br>

    Web client: is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. <br>

    !!!A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine!!! <br>

    n order to connect to and display websites on their device, a user needs to have a web browser installed.[2]<br>

    function of Web browser: fetch information resources and display them on a user's device
